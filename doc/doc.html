<h2 id="handling-of-the-log-file" class="section"><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Handling of the Log File</h2>
<p>There are two different ways how EffortLog handles the log file:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the specified log file does not exist EffortLog will create it and start writing to it.</li>
<li>If the specified log file does exist EffortLog will append to the end of file. This way, old logs are never overwritten.</li>
</ul>
<p>To further evaluate the log file external software can be used. There are several programs which are able to read JSON files as well as interfaces to most of the programming languages.</p>
