    The log file is formatted in JSON. It contains of the following entries:
    <ul>
      <li>"InitialProjectStage": The initial development stage of the project. This was specified during the configuration wizard. The choices for the stage are:
      <ul>
        <li>Scratch</li>
        <li>Working serial version</li>
        <li>Tuned serial version</li>

        <li>Tuned parallel version</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li>"InitialProjectStageComment": A user-provieded comment on the above development stage.
      <li>"LoggingEvents": A list of the logging events sorted by the occurance. Each entry consists of the following keys:
      <ul>
        <li>"ID": A unique identifier of the event. The first event holds id 0 and all following events are then consecutively numbered.</li>
        <li>"UserName": The user's name. This was specified during the configuration wizard.</li>
        <li>"ProjectTitle": The title of the project. This was specified during the configuration wizard.</li>
        <li>"ProjectStage": The current development stage of the project. This was specified during the configuration wizard. The choices for the stage are:
        <ul>
          <li>Scratch</li>
          <li>Working serial version</li>
          <li>Tuned serial version</li>
          <li>Working parallel version</li>
          <li>Tuned parallel version</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>"ActivityType": The chosen type of activity. The user is provided with a list of the following activities:

        <li>"Comment": Contains a comment on the activity. If the user did not enter any comment this field is empty.</li>
        <li>"CurLoggingTime": The time when the user finished the questionnaire.</li>
        <li>"Interval": The time in minutes since the last stored logging event.</li>
        <li>"LastLoggingTime": The time when the user finished the questionnaire the time before the current event.</li>
        <li>"LoggingInterval": The specified logging interval. This was specified during the configuration wizard.</li>
