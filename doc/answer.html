    <h3 class="chapter">4.2 How to answer the questionnaire</h3>

    There are some default activities to choose:
    <ul>
      <li>Break
      <li>Thinking
      <li>Serial
      <li>Parallelizing
      <li>Testing
      <li>Debugging
      <li>Tuning
      <li>Experimenting
    </ul>
    To get the results of the logs as accurate as possible please only choose an activity from this list if it falls under this category. If you are uncertain if it belongs to one of the categories above or you worked on something different please choose other from the list. If you did choose other activity please describe it in detail in the comment field.<br>
    <br>
    The comment field is used to keep track of additionally information you want to add to your logs.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to take a brake for some time longer than the default logging interval you do not have to quit the program. You might just let it run in the background and it will set a bigger time slot for your break as soon as you return back to your work place.
