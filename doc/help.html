    <h2 class="chapter">1 Using the help browser</h2>

    <p>
    You can get help by hitting <strong>help</strong> from the application menu bar under Help. Additionally you can always bring up this help browser by hitting <strong>F1</strong> from your keyboard if you are running Windows or Linux operating systems or <strong>Command+?</strong> if you are on Mac OS X.<br>
    <br>
    This help is split into multiple files which are connected through links. These are highlighted with a blue color of the text. Additionally each of the help files provides a simple navigation in the upper part of the window. This navigation will guide you through the whole help document if you hit the "next" button. You can go back to the last help file with the "back" button. Additionally you can go at any time back to the top of the documentation by hitting the "top" button.<br>
    <br>
    The help browser might look like the following:

    <div class="block-image"><img src="images/help.png" alt="images/help.png"></div>

  </body>
