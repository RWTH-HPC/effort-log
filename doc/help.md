Using the Help Browser {#using-the-help-browser .chapter}
======================

You can get help by hitting **help** from the application menu bar under
Help. Additionally you can always bring up this help browser by hitting
**F1** from your keyboard if you are running Windows or Linux operating
systems or **Command+?** if you are on Mac OS X.

This help is split into multiple files which are connected through
links. These are highlighted with a blue color of the text. Additionally
each of the help files provides a simple navigation in the upper part of
the window. This navigation will guide you through the whole help
document if you hit the **next** button. You can go back to the last
help file with the **back** button. Additionally you can go at any time
back to the top of the documentation by hitting the **top** button.

The help browser might look like +@fig:help.
