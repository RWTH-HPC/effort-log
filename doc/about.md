EffortLog was started in 2015 at the IT Center of RWTH Aachen
University. Its main purpose is to provide a simple program to aid
developers in tracking their programming efforts. The gained data can
than be evaluated for researching purposes on programming effort
analysis. Please see
[www.hpc.rwth-aachen.de/research/tco](http://www.hpc.rwth-aachen.de/research/tco)
for more information on the research done with EffortLog.
