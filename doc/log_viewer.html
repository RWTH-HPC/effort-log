    <h3 class="section">3.1 Elements of the log file viewer</h3>

    The log file viewer consists of a convenient tree view to allow for a quick overview over preject's activities and milestones during the active development. It can be used to review the main development efforts and performance improvements.

    The activities are grouped by date and hold their identifier, comment, activity, development duration in minutes and if available the according milestone(s). If a milestone exists for the activity, the type of milestone with the respective performance measure is displayed.

    The respective activities of a date can be viewed by clicking on the date in the first column of the viewer and can be hidden by clicking it again. A close button is located in the lower right of the window.

    Note that this window holds a viewer only. No changes to the underlying log file can be made.
